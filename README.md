# About
Blog posts have been a great help on my programming journey. So much so that when I saw the Email requesting I chose
and worked on a project, I already knew what I wanted to do. I learnt alot during the 2 weeks development time we
were allotted to complete the project. This is the biggest website/project I have worked on at the moment and I am
proud with how it turned out
